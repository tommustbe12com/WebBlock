# WebBlock
Windows-based ease-of-use hosts file editor. Made in AutoIt. https://tommustbe12.com/web-block for more information.

## What it does
It changes whatever site you put in to point to 127.0.0.1 (localhost) instead of the real site.

## What version of OS?
Works with Windows 10 and 11.

## How to use
Download and run the exe file. Windows may tell you it protected you, but it is not malware. click more info, run anyway.

Everything there is self-explanatory. You can visit [this page](https://tommustbe12.com/web-block/about/) for more information.

## Things to know
On some displays it looks different. It's possible that on your display the executable's interactive buttons will not be clickable and/or viewable. To fix this you can change your resolution settings or change the hosts file directly.
You can delete webblock's exe file and the website will **still** be blocked. Please note that removing the software will **not** unblock any currently blocked websites! To unblock it use the unblock feature or edit the hosts file directly.

On my channel I have a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUasygkrak4) explaining editing the hosts file in detail.

## Enjoy!
I've spent a lot of time developing this executable in general. I hope you like it!
